Project Title:
 - Analysing the changes in driver safety in Formula 1 over time

Team Members:
 - Troy Foote
 - Erica Rojas Wood
 - Oliver King

Project Description/Outline:
 - Formula 1 has been vocal about driver safety initiatives in recent decades. Has the sport of Formula 1 become safer for competing drivers?

Research Questions to Answer:
  1.	Has the rate of fatal accidents in Formula 1 events decreased over time?
    - Also show the number of driver fatalities relative to the number of race participants.
  2.	Has the rate of injury due to accidents in Formula 1 events decreased over time?
    - Also show the number of driver injuries relative to the number of race participants.
    - Also show the number of accidents/collisions over time and compare this to the number of injuries. This can be an indicator of car safety.
  3.	Have street or road circuits been less safe for drivers than dedicated race circuits?

Datasets to be Used:
