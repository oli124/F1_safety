F1_safety

Project Title:
 - Analysing the changes in driver safety in Formula 1 over time

Team Members:
 - Troy Foote
 - Erica Rojas Wood
 - Oliver King

Project Description/Outline:
 - Formula 1 has been vocal about driver safety initiatives in recent decades. Has the sport of Formula 1 become safer for competing drivers?

Research Questions to Answer:
  1.	Has the rate of fatal accidents in Formula 1 events decreased over time?
    - Also show the number of driver fatalities relative to the number of race participants.
  2.	Has the rate of injury due to accidents in Formula 1 events decreased over time?
    - Also show the number of driver injuries relative to the number of race participants.
    - Also show the number of accidents/collisions over time and compare this to the number of injuries. This can be an indicator of car safety.
  3.	Have street or road circuits been less safe for drivers than dedicated race circuits?

Datasets to be Used:
 - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jtrotman/formula-1-race-data?select=races.csv
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_fatalities
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_circuits
 
File directory for F1_safety repo:
- The "Notebooks" folder contains the Jupyter notebooks with script used to read in,  clean and analyse the datasets, as well as generate the visualisations.
- The "Resources" folder contains the a range of CSV datasets used as the basis for the analysis.
- The "Visualisations" folder contains .png's of all visualisations created and used in the presentation.
- In addition, contained in the repo homepage is:
  - The group's Powerpoint presentation.
  - The readme file for the project.
  - A short text file "Analysis and Conclusions" outlining the project's key findings.

Breakdown of Tasks:
     - Create repo and share details
 - Answer question 1:
     - Create visualisation of driver fatalities vs. time;
     - Create visualisation of driver fatalities vs. number of competing drivers;
     - Write up analysis and conclusions;
     - Create power point to showcase findings (approx. 3 slides);
      - (ERW to work on)
 - Answer question 2:
     - Create visualisation of driver injuries vs. time;
     - Create visualisation of driver injuries vs. number of competing drivers;
     - Create visualisation of accidents/collisions vs. driver injuries;
     - Write up analysis and conclusions;
     - Create power point to showcase findings (approx. 3 slides)
      - (TF to work on)
 - Answer question 3:
     - Create a visualisation of  driver fatalities vs. street circuit event, driver fatalities vs. road circuit event, driver fatalities vs. dedicated race circuit event (all on same plot);
     - Create a visualisation of breakdown of track types;
     - Write up analysis and conclusions;
     - Create power point to showcase findings (approx. 3 slides);
      - (OK to work on)
