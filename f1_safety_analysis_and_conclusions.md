1.	Has the rate of fatal accidents in Formula 1 events decreased over time?

The analytic data used for the fatalities and drivers per race was a reflection on how the sport was organised and implemented since the beginnings in 1950. Unlike today, in the earlier decades of the sport, there were significant fluctuations in the number of drivers in each race, as well as the number of drivers involved in the sport. It is interesting to note that while there was great fluctuation competitor numbers from race to race, the number of annual fatalities seem to not vary significantly (based off the data analysed).

It seems as though the greatest changes in number of fatalities during F1 races occurred in the 90s where a number of changes to factors including circuits, cars, drivers and the organisation itself started to be implemented and have continued to be implemented since. The data collected in regards to fatalities shows that both the number of deaths, and frequency of deaths has decreased markedly in the last three decades.

2.	Has the rate of injury due to accidents in Formula 1 events decreased over time?

Accidents v injuries do show a reduction in accidents over time since the late 1970â€™s through to the most recent season in 2022.

Injuries have not shown any real periods of increase or reduction other than a small spike of 3 recorded injuries in 1994.

3.	Have street or road circuits been less safe for drivers than dedicated race circuits?

The analysis shows that road circuits have historically had a higher fatality rate than dedicated race circuits. This is evident in the Fatalities per Grand Prix (or fatalities per event) metric which was higher for road circuits (at 0.0857) than for dedicated race circuits (at 0.0463).

In addition, the analysis also shows that street circuits have historically had a lower fatality rate than dedicated race circuits. This is evident in the same Fatalities per Grand Prix metric which was lower for street circuits (at 0.0099) than for dedicated race circuits (at 0.0463).
